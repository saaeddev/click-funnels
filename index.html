            <!-- step 1 -->
            <div class="line"></div>
            <div class="step">
                <div class="main-header">1. Product Secrets</div>

                </div>
                <p>The <b>FIRST</b> training you’ll get inside FunnelFlix is called Product Secrets...</p>
                <p>And there is a very <b><u><i>specific reason why</i></u></b> I opened up this course for you to
                    watch… </p>
                <p>See, there is a shocking similarity between nearly <b>ALL</b> of the Funnel Hackers who decide not to
                    continue with ClickFunnels after their trial ends…</p>
                <p>It’s <b><u>NOT</u></b> that they don’t love ClickFunnels…</p>
                <p>It’s <b><u>NOT</u></b> that they don’t know how to make easy funnels and pages… (we’ve designed it
                    for the average non-techie entrepreneur who doesn’t know how to read a single line of code, just
                    like me). </p>
                <div class="middle-header">It’s that they DON’T have a product to sell yet!</div>
                <p>I don’t want that to be a hurdle for you a moment longer!</p>
                <p>So inside Product Secrets, I will walk you through <b><u>27 different ways you can quickly put
                            together a product to sell online...</u></b></p>
                <p>If you have no idea what to sell just yet, or you know what to sell, but you’re having trouble
                    figuring out a cool or sexy way to package your product together, then <b>THIS</b> is the perfect
                    place to start!</p>
                <p><i>The best part?</i> You won’t have to wait around months or years to complete your product…</p>
                <p>In fact, you can use these product-creation ideas that I share to help you <b>create your product in
                        just ONE WEEKEND!</b></p>
                <p>By the end of this training, you should have <b>PAGES</b> of notes, and at least 27 ways to make your
                    product! <b>All YOU</b> need to do is pick one that resonates with you, and start creating!</p>

                <p>I’ve been so lucky and blessed to be friends with Tony Robbins for over a decade now…</p>
                <p>Not only have I had the chance to be business partners with him, but he’s come to speak at our Funnel
                    Hacking LIVE event multiple times!</p>
                <p>I met Tony many years ago during a tough time in my life when I was struggling in my business, and my
                    marriage…</p>
                <p>Tony came and helped me <b>REWIRE</b> my brain to help me become more successful in each of those

                                <p>During his presentation, Tony taught our entrepreneurs <b>how to get all the junk OUT

                                <p>It turned into a 4 ½ hour presentation, with hotseats, and journaling, and mindset

                see
                how powerful of a business tool it really is, it should get you excited to stick around as one of our

            <p><b><u>P.S.</u></b> REMEMBER: You can waste a ton of time and money paying hiring out a tech team to get
                your
                funnel built (and wait potentially weeks or months, while the launch of your funnel is literally in
                their
                hands)...</p>
            <p><b>OR</b></p>
            <p>You can take the power back, and build your own funnels, with a system that’s specifically designed for
                entrepreneurs (not techies) to use! And you can get your funnel built and LIVE in as little as 10
                minutes...
                Your choice.</p>
            <p><b><u>P.S.S.</u></b> If I was able to use this SIMPLE funnel-building system to create pages and funnels
                in
                minutes…</p>
            <p>Without being a “tech wizard”...</p>
            <p>Without knowing how to read or write a single line of code…</p>
